Technologies I used in this project were: Responsive layout, Media queries

Challenges I faced:

I understimated this project really badly. Looking at the projects I did in the past this actually looked easy in my eyes.
It wasn't - atleast for me it wasn't.
-I struggled with making a table on the bottom of the page;
-I have to definetly refresh on my Semantic HTML - using main & picture its definetly not enough;
-I looked at the design they made for 375px but I do not have a device like that so I went with 430px+ so I can actually see the mobile version of this on my phone;
<br>
The thing I'm proud of - I think the layout for this project will look amazing - still a lot of things to change but I'm getting better with measuring paddings, pixels and margins.
